# What's CS

Most people assume that a Bachelors in Computer Science is all about programming
and the foundations that you need for your career as a software engineer. However,
that's far from the truth. Computer Science is all about how a computer works, not
how to build stuff with them.

## Why CS

1. Teaches you the **low level** implementation details of a computer

2. Gives you a solid foundation on **algorithms** and **data structres**
